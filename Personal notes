Here I will upload all the notes I made while solving the exercises. So you'll find them scattered in each problem, they were not grouped individually.
I wish there could've been notes that helped me, that's why I'm posting these. If I do make especial notes for each lesson, I will leave info about that here somewhere.
These were the EPFL questions for the Homework Sheets. So it's not owned by INPV, but by EPFL. I hope it's okay to publish them here, as most of the questions are publically accessible through moodle archive.
EPFL moodle archive:

I will include the notes of only Analyse 1, Analyse 2, Physique, GÃ©ometrie Analytique. I had not made any notes on Informatique (CS), because their lecture notes and Homework sheets are very clear. 
You can find the LN and the HW, by visiting moodle 2020-2021, and accessing CMS, then ICS.
