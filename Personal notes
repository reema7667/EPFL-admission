Here I will upload all the notes I made while solving the exercises. So you'll find them scattered in each problem, they were not grouped individually.
I wish there could've been notes that helped me, that's why I'm posting these. If I do make especial notes for each lesson, I will leave info about that here somewhere. 
These include the EPFL questions for the Homework Sheets, but I would advise you to consult moodle for more comprehensive Homework Sheets and Corrigé.
So it's not owned by INPV, but by EPFL. I hope it's okay to publish them here, as most of the questions are publically accessible through moodle archive.
EPFL moodle archive:

I will include the notes of only Analyse 1, Physique, Géometrie Analytique. I had not made any notes on Informatique (CS), because their lecture notes and Homework sheets are very clear. 
You can find the LN and the HW, by visiting moodle 2020-2021, and accessing CMS, then ICS.

Here's a link to the google drive that contains my notes: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1l-JfeHXSteXM3kPf78M61FmY9hG7HzFL?usp=sharing

It will also include a special note for réduction forme canonique, which you will need for Géometrie Analytique série 19-22.
It will also include a resumé made by EPFL for CMS, it's especially helpful for Algébre Linéaire and Géometrie Analytique.
It's also a useful formulas recap for the remaining subjects. However, do not rely on the Computer part, is it's outdated.
