# EPFL-admission

Information on the reduced admission's test to EPFL’s Bachelors. 

-Intro: 

There are multiple pathways to entering the bachelors. For example, there's the direct entry by application to first year. Or for those who don't qualify, there's a preparatory year called the CMS, which stands for Cours Mathémathique Spécial. If you don't qualify for either, your last option is the exam. However, you could take 2-years to study for a maturité, which is kind of like the high school equivilant in Switzerland, then you could retry the application for first year. I tried to study for the exam, rather than taking the maturité. Thus, I'll only expand on my experience.

*Note: for transparency I was not able to take the exam due to my country's ban on travel because of COVID-19. However, I did spend an entire year prepping for the exam (Sep 2020-May2021).

- What is the exam? 
The exam is to be taken over 4 days. It's basically all the natural sciences except Biology, plus Computer Science. It's heavily reliant on advanced math. Think AP calculus + Linear algebra and geometry in the American system *on steroids*. It is somewhat comparable to the JEET in the indian system, but in my POV it expands more on the maths.

- How tough is the exam? 
This test is no joke. It says on the site, passing the exam is like succeeding in the preparatory year (CMS) at EPFL. But do no be fooled, it's not just a preparatory year, it's a year to vet the students. Failure rate in the CMS is very high, from what I got around half of the students drop out after the 1st term. To really understand why it would be a tough exam, just think about this: EPFL is a public university with very little fees. It aceepts a lot of international students. However, 50% of those who qualify for the direct-entry to first year fail it. So, the University cannot afford to accept students who don't qualify for neither the direct entry nor the CMS to fail the first year too. Hence, the exam has to be very comprehensive and assures a high-level of understanding. 

- Ok, the exam is not easy, so how can I study for it?
Basicaly, to study for the exam, you would have to study most of what students' of the CMS study.There are some private schools in Switzerland that teach this, however they all do this on 1 term, but the CMS is an entire year. I'll be providing links for them, and my own experience further below.

So here's a breakdown of what the CMS roughly study in a year, which you have to do too:
Math1: (throughout the year)
Algebre Linear
Geometrie analytique

Math2: (throughout the year) -Calculus
Analyse1 
Analyse2

Physics: 
1st term: Mechanics
2nd term: Electricity and Magnatism

Computer science:
1st term: intro to Python(data structures) & Algorithms
2nd term: Numerical Methods

Chemistry: 
1 term: general with no organic chemistry

So in total, this is 4 subjects in math, physics, CS that span a year + chemistry.

- About the private schools: 

I was a national high-school baccaloreate from Saudi Arabia. So I can only speak for someone who has followed a similar national Curriculum. We follow the basic American national education in Arabic, for comparison. You can look up high-school McGraw Hill.

 My school, Institut Privé Voltaire-INPV, thought us by giving us lectures that were too heavliy based on theory, then gave us the same Home work sheets of the CMS. They gave each subject 3 hours/week, 2hr were spent on theory and the last hour was solving around 2 questions of the HW sheets. They also provided monthly Q&As. Each subject at the EPFL, except chemisty & Algebra, has around 21-26 HW sheets, 6-8 questions. Thus, with the limited time, my school gave us two sheets per subject per week. We finished all the material in 14 weeks. They also provided Lecture notes. I'll leave it to you to imagine how quick the pace was, after you look at the sample questions that are taken out of the sheets here- you'll have to make an account first:

I think INPV could have done a better job on the lecture notes, making them more relevant to the questions. I thought it would have been better if we had spent most of our time just solving questions, instead of a lot of theory. their perspective was to let us try the questions first, but I thought the gap between the theory and the questions was too large for this tactic to work well.

But you mentioned you studied for a whole year academic year, but the test is in Januray?  
Yes, I did because of Covid they had to push the exam's date to May 2021, instead of January 2021. But we weren't aware of this until the end of December 2020.



- What did you find hardest about your studies? 
Lack of resources, a lot of material, and questions that were genuinely hard to solve. The questions are not onlu hard because of the material, but because they are asked in a creative way that I was not used to.
